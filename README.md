# Signals-and-Systems

Software used: MATLAB

Performed a lab with the aims to:
1. determine the frequency response of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system
2. examine the steady-state response and the transient response of an LTI system
3. investigate the relationship between the values of poles and zeros of the transfer function and the response of the system
